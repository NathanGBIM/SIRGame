		 An object of this class is a world in which the simulation takes place.

		Attributes:

		- w(int) and h(int): the width and height of the world

		- pop(agent[]): the list of agent (class in agent.py) forming the population simulated

		- obstacles((int,int)[]): a list of (x,y) tuple, coordinates occupied by the obstacles

		Lists of method:

		- __init__

		- __str__

		- put_obstacles

		- create_agents

		- nb

		- move

		- infect

		- contact

		- recover_or_die

		- run

		- stats

		- erase

		Note : in the main section of the world.py file is commented an example of worlds creation and export in a .txt file.

		This was used as test during the coding phase and was left as tool if the project was to be continued.
