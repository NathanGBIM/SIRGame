class Agent(object):
	'''Agent class

	 An object of this class is an individual of the simulation.

	Attributes:

	- x(int) and y(int) its coordinates in the grid.

	- state(string) an attribute that equals "SUSCEPTIBLE" if he didn't contract the virus yet, "INFECTIOUS" if he is infected, "RECOVERED" if it recovered from it, and "DEAD" if it died.

	- id(int) its unique ID, starting from 0 and incrementing each time an agent is created

	- p_infection(float) its probability of infecting another susceptible agent when entering in contact with it

	- p_recovery(float) its probability of recovering if it is infected at each time step

	- p_death(float) its probability of dying if it is infected at each time step

	Lists of method:

	- __init__

	- __str__

	- move

	- recover_or_die

	Note : in the main section of the agent.py file is commented an example of agents creation and export in a .txt file.

	This was used as test during the coding phase and was left as tool if the project was to be continued.
