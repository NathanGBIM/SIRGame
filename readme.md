# SIRGame 

This Python 3.6 package aims to simulate graphically a viral infection epidemic.

It was develloped during an "Algorithm and Programming" class, part of the "Bioinformatic and Modelisation" cursus at Insa Lyon (Biosciences).

The instructions of the practical class can be found inside the file "tp-SIR.pdf".


### Quick Note

In this actual context of Covid19 epidemic, it seems more and more important to create tools that can help us to study epidemic infection.

This software, while quite basic, could be improved upon to simulate more complex models, and it's graphical functionality could lead to it be used in an educational purpose for example.

### Dependencies

+ `pip install tkinter` version 8.6.8
+ `pip install math` version 3.5

### Installation 

`pip install SIRG'

### Tutorials

A jupyter notebook describing how to use SIRGame is located in the "tutorial" directory.

A Documentation can be found [...]

### TODO

-add new obstacles configuration
-automatisation of the reset fonction when creating a new grid
-write the visual simulation part in its own class file
